We'll have to use 3rd party libraries, specifically "moment".

grab the moment package to check what time it actually is, and base your styling off of that

save your to dos for each hour and refresh your page. they should stay - that's local storage.

check the css. the styles are there for what you're trying to do, for the most part.
