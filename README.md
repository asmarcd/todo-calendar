# Daily To Do List
This is an hourly planner that allows you to store items you need to do each hour in the day. Hours that have passed will show up in gray, future ones in green, and the current hour in gray. These times are pulled into the site using moment.js.

When you click the save button on the right, the text you've typed into the box will be saved to local storage, allowing you to leave the page and return without losing what you've put in.
